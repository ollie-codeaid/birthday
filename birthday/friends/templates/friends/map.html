	<h1>The Plan</h1>
	One day, five pubs, lots of fun!
	</br></br>
	We will be kicking off at 3.30pm at The Grapes and meandering towards The Dickens Inn 
	throughout the afternoon/early evening (see route detail below). If you can't join from 
	the start then feel free to catch us up along the way. I'll be doing my best to keep to 
	the timetable at the bottom of this page.
	</br></br>
	I will be setting challenges over the course of the day and awarding points accordingly 
	- challenges probably won't be drinks based. Points will be recorded live on this website. 
	As the competition will undoubtebly be fierce there will be a prize for whomever has
	accumulated the most points by the end of the day.
